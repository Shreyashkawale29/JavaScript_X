// Given an array arr. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

// Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

// Examples:

arr = [15, 2, 45, 4 , 7]
// Output: [2, 4]
// Explanation: Here, arr[2] = 2 exists here and arr[4] = 4 exists here.
// Input: arr[] = [1]
// Output: [1]
// Explanation: Here arr[1] = 1 exists.
